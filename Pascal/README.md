# SphereContour
Program for automatic contouring of spherical orientation data using a modified Kamb method to create spherical projections including Schmidt (equal-area) and stereographic (equal-angle) plots. Additional files include example data files.

## Notes
This is a command line program created using Borland Turbo Pascal and BGI graphics. The algorithms are identical to the C version. It has not been updated to run in Delphi or Free Pascal, and has been superseded by [__Orient__](https://vollmerf.github.io/orient/).

## Related Software
The program [__Orient__](https://vollmerf.github.io/orient/) by this author is free software that includes this functionality, and numerous additional options. It runs on Macintosh, Windows, and Linux platforms.

This repostory contains C, Pascal, and MATLAB implementations of the algorithm presented in:

__Vollmer, F.W., 1995. C program for automatic contouring of spherical 
orientation data using a modified Kamb method: Computers & Geosciences, 
v. 21, n. 1, p. 31-49.__

which should be cited by publications using this code, algorithm, or derivative 
works, to produce figures or other content. 

The C and Pascal code is complete but not updated for current systems as it is superseded by [Orient](https://vollmerf.github.io/orient). The MATLAB script should run on current MATLAB and Octave software.
